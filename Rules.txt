I really like you included rules, especially since I did not know this variation!

Russian War
Also known as P'yansita (translates to Drunkard), is normally played by 2 players.
The deck consists of 36 cards, A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6 of each suit.  While not impossible to use the whole deck it is not normally utilized.
Two variations are in called prior to the start.
Variation 1 is to collect or not to run out of cards.
Variation 2 is to get rid of all your cards.
After deciding which variation, the cards are dealt.
Commencing the game, which starts like the standard version of War, whom ever had the winning "trick" wins the card  or loosing "trick" takes the card pening variation.
Card ranking: Ace(high) and 6 (low), however the 6 can beat an Ace but can not beat other cards.  If full 52 cards are being used then the 2 takes the place of the 6.
If a tie during a trick happens then another card is dealt to break and so forth until then, whom ever wins/looses receives the cards.
End of game: If variation 1 is played, the looser is the drunkard who "spent all his money". While variation 2, the looser has all the cards and is the drunkard who "had all the booze".
