War Russian Style:

<!--I really liked that you separate them into different levels!!  -->
Stage: Bronze:
    This is considered my bronze stage, while at the end of this week of 22FEB2016 having completed the game in the rules of the Russia War game.

Stage: Silver:
  The War (Russian Version) at the moment incorporates all 52 cards and allowed for the Ace to beat the 6.  We were tasked with our first project to utilize a staging of level.  

Stage: Gold:

Glitches: In the bronze stage I had inline coding for jquery and when attempted to place in the js file the game broke.
