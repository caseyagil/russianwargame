### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

***Great job including Bronze, Silver, and Gold Levels! Just remember to complete user stories for next time :)***


* __Technical Requirements__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

***Project 1 is challenging, and your game effectively meets all of the technical requirements! Additionally, your project is really creative, and I loved how you chose to do a Russian War style implementation over the American Version***


* __Code Quality__:  **Meets Expectations**

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

***I found errors that popped up in the console and some of your code isn't quite functioning as expected. Try to follow naming conventions of variables, especially in for loops, and watch out for things like indentation. They are subtle and might seem picky, but it's really helpful when you are going back to read over code, troubleshoot errors, or refactor!***


* __Problem Solving__: **Meets Expectations**

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

***Great job working through your first project and overcoming challenges! I think tomorrow's workshop will be helpful in further refactoring and working through some of your errors***
